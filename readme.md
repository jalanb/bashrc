# Motto

Premature abbreviation is the root of all evil

## Problem

Bash commands are toooooo long

* Sucks to be me

## Solution

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jalanb/jab (and /cde, /whyp, /ackvim)
$ cd jab
$ bash home/.link
$ source jab/__init__.sh
```

* `cd` is now `c`
* `ls -1` is now `l`
* `pip install --force-reinstall requirements.txt; pip install --force-reinstall -e .` is now `pipy -f` 

and I can get back to coding 

# New Motto

```
Live
    Let Go
           Lose It 
    Love
Laugh
```

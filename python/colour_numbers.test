The colour_numbers module
=========================

	>>> import colour_numbers
	>>> print colour_numbers.__doc__
	Convert between some numbers known to represent colours
	...

Convert html strings to integers
--------------------------------

A "web colour" is represented by a string with 3 hex values for R, G, B
	For example
	>>> html = '#00FF00'

Converting that to an integer and back gives itself
	>>> html == colour_numbers.integer_to_html(colour_numbers.html_to_integer(html))
	True

Same result if we start with slight variations on the string
	>>> html == colour_numbers.integer_to_html(colour_numbers.html_to_integer(html.lower()))
	True
	>>> html == colour_numbers.integer_to_html(colour_numbers.html_to_integer(html.replace('#','0x')))
	True

We can also use 3 single chars
	>>> html == colour_numbers.integer_to_html(colour_numbers.html_to_integer('0x0F0'))
	True

Any 3-char hex string is same as the 6-char version by just doubling the characters
	(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Shorthand_hexadecimal_form)
	>>> colour_numbers.html_to_integer('0x09C') == colour_numbers.html_to_integer('#0099cc')
	True

Converting html colours to ANSI colours
---------------------------------------

Convert an HTML colour string to an ANSI code (which is a number)
	(Test values here come from http://www.frexx.de/xterm-256-notes/data/xterm-colortest)

	>>> html, ansi = '#875F5F', 95
	>>> colour_numbers.html_to_ansi(html) == ansi
	True

And back again
	>>> colour_numbers.ansi_to_html(ansi) == html
	True

VGA colours
-----------

"Pure" colours have ANSI values less than 16 and come in "dark" and "light" shades
	These colours were used on very old terminals, back when I was a lad

For example, darker blue
Dark blue
	>>> colour_numbers.ansi_to_html(4) == '#000080'
	True

Lighter blue:
	>>> colour_numbers.ansi_to_html(12) == '#0000FF'
	True

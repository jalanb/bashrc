My idea of what the garden can be is taking more shape


And I'm gonna base the next stage on bamboos, wisteria, ivy and roses




Whenever they come into season. And lots of soil for them, if you dig around there, you reach brick soon.


Bamboos that'll spread, but get chopped when young on the West side, and wisterias among them. That line is about 10/15m long, and could grow 2/3 types of bamboo. Plenty of space behind the line for them to spread. But at the front there's wisteria.


On the blank wall of the old cottage I'd like red ivy and climbing roses. The more riotous the colors the better! And standing roses for in front of the cottage. where I'll want some high flowers, daisy and foxgloves, and sunflower ... ones that don't care how much grass is growing. Lotsa purple, red, yellow, white above the grasses in the hedges round here.

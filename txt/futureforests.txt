Subject: I know what grows here

And I'm gonna base the next stage on bamboos, wisteria, ivy and roses
    Whenever they come into season. And lots of soil for them, if you dig around there, you reach brick soon.
    Bamboos that'll spread, but get chopped on the West side for the wisterias . Gives them about 10/15m long, 2/3 types of bamboo?

On the blank wall of the old cottage I'd like red ivy and climbing roses.
And standing roses for in front of the cottage.
Where I'll want some high flowers, daisy and foxgloves, and sunflower
